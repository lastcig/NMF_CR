Chord Recognition using the features generated by unsupervised NMF.

Concept: Current 12 bin Chorma(PCP) approach lost much information by the folding process of chroma. Unlike chroma, the new feature bases are factorized vector component from pitch spectrum(Constant Q spectrum).
We expect better performance on deterministic classifier (like SVM), when we use the new bases.
